<p>I live in <strong>Chicago</strong> (aka.The Windy City). Chicago has been my home for a year now and I'm in love with the city!!.</p>

<p> I'm currently a masters student at UIC pursuing my masters in Computer Science. Technology has been part of me since a long time now, making me passionate about various aspects of the stream. I love working on new technologies at the<strong> <a href="https://www.evl.uic.edu/" target="_blank" 	>Electonic and Visualisation Laboratory</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Apart from being a student/techie, I have extreme passion for <strong>entreprenuership, strategy</strong> and <strong>business development</strong>. During my free time, I love to read books authored by the Gurus of various fields. </p>
